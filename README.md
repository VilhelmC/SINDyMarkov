# SINDy Markov Chain Model

This project implements an analytical Markov chain model for predicting success probabilities in the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm with Sequential Thresholded Least Squares (STLSQ).

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the experiments to generate data:
bash

python scripts/run_experiments.py

Analyze the results:
```
python scripts/analyze_results.py
```

Alternatively, explore the analysis in the interactive notebook:

```
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis_notebook.ipynb
```
