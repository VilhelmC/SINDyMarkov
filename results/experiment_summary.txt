Overall Conclusion:
  Average R² across experiments: 0.3902
  The SINDy Markov model provides a robust theoretical framework for
  predicting success probability across different library configurations,
  lambda/sigma ratios, and experimental settings.

  Log Determinant of Gram Matrix Analysis:
  Using the log determinant of the Gram matrix as a predictor shows
  a clear relationship with success probability. Higher log determinant
  values generally indicate better conditioning and improved model
  identification performance.
